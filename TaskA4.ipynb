    "## Task A4. Comparison between the stochastic and deterministic SIR models (worth approximately 12% of the marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment:** The end goal of this task is to run 100 simulations of the stochastic SIR model, generate a plot showing the mean value of $I(t)$ (averaged across all of the simulations) versus $t$, and then compare this output to the analogous output from the deterministic SIR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details: \n",
    "- We will use the following parameter values for the baseline case (where, throughout this assignment, time is measured in days): $\\beta = 3 \\times 10^{-4}$, $\\mu = 0.1$, $N = 10^{3}$.\n",
    "- In each simulation, there will be 10 individuals infected initially (with the rest of the population susceptible).\n",
    "- The most challenging part of this task is that, in each simulation, events will occur at different times. As a result, we have to write code that, for each simulation, extracts the value of $I(t)$ at a set of pre-defined values of $t$. One way to do this is to set up a vector at the beginning of the simulation containing 201 blank entries (corresponding to $t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 100$), and then populate the relevant entries after each event (i.e. put the value of $I$ before the current event in all entries corresponding to times between the last event time and the current one). This vector can then be averaged across all simulations.\n",
    "- The code in the Python notebook entitled \"Epidemiology_Part_A4_with_Errors\" is a first attempt at writing such code (i.e. code that outputs a vector $I_{vals}$ with entries recording the values of $I$ at $t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 100$) for a single simulation of the stochastic SIR model, but it contains three mistakes. Correct this code (and then copy the resulting code into your answer to this task in this notebook).\n",
    "- Now that you have corrected the code described above, run 100 simulations of the stochastic SIR model and plot the average values of the vector $I_{vals}$, plotted at $t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 100$.\n",
    "- Finally, on the same axes, plot the analogous numerical solution of the determinstic SIR model. The team member who completed Task A1 (above) should be able to help you with this.\n",
