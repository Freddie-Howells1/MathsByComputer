    "The introduction and/or removal of social distancing can be modelled by varying the infection rate parameter, $\\beta$. In this exercise, we will use the following time-dependent infection rate parameter:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\beta(t)  = 2 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{  whenever  } t < T, \\\\\n",

    "- For this task, use the values $\\mu = 0.1$, $N = 10^{6}$, and assume that the initial values of $(S,I,R)$ are $(N-5,5,0)$.\n",
    "- Run the SIR model, adapted according to the time-dependent value of $\\beta$ described above, for a value of $T = 30$ days. Plot a time-series showing $S(t)$, $I(t)$ and $R(t)$.\n",
    "- Consider a scenario in which $T$ is not necessarily 30 days, and can instead take a fixed integer value between 1 and 200 days. Write a FOR loop to identify the value of $T$ that minimises the maximum value of $I$ in the model simulation. Plot the maximum value of $I$ as a function of $T$, and print the value of $T$ that \"flattens the curve\" most.\n",
