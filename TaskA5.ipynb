    "## Task A5. The probability of a major outbreak (worth approximately 12% of the marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment:** Run 1000 simulations of the stochastic SIR model, starting from a single infected individual (with the remainder of the population susceptible). Count the number of simulations in which the final value of $I+R$ exceeds 10 (i.e. the number for which $R>10$ when $I$ hits zero), and compare this to the analytic estimate for the \"probability of a major outbreak\" described in the Lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details: \n",
    "- Use the following parameter values for the baseline case (where time is again measured in days): $\\beta = 3 \\times 10^{-4}$, $\\mu = 0.1$, $N = 10^{3}$.\n",
    "- Recall from the lecture that the analytic estimate for the probability of a major outbreak is $p = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$, where $R_0 = \\frac{\\beta N}{\\mu}$.\n",
    "- Run 1000 simulations of the stochastic SIR model. Calculate (and print) the proportion of simulations in which the final value of $I+R$ exceeds 10.\n",
    "- Calculate and print the analogous analytic estimate for the probability of a major outbreak.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hint: To run 1000 simulations of the stochastic SIR model, you will need to use a FOR loop. To run the simulations more quickly, you do not have to store the values of $t$, $S$, $I$ and $R$ after every event (instead, simply store the value of $I + R$ at the end of the simulation).\n",
